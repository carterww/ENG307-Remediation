                            Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) is a competetive first person shooter with two competing teams.
                            The first team is composed of terrorists, and their goal is to plant the bomb on one of two bombsites.
                            The second team is composed of counter-terrorists, and their goal is to prevent the terrorists from planting the bomb.
                            Each team is made up of five players, and they collaborate in order to attack or defend the bomb sites.
                            This guide will provide a general overview of some essential CSGO topics.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Play CSGO?</h2>
                        <p>
                            CSGO is a great game that allows for a variety of play styles;
                            some players enjoy casually playing a game with some friends, while other enjoy competing at the highest level.
                            Either play style is completely valid, and, of course, there are play styles that lie somewhere in between the two.
                            You'll just have to find what kind of play style you enjoy the most.
                            Hopefully after reading this guide, you'll be able to pick up the game and discover how you want to play it.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Basic Gameplay Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            As stated previously, CSGO is a first person shooter where two teams, each consisting of five players, compete against one another.
                            The teams spawn on opposite ends on the map, and the counter-terrorists try to stop the terrorists from planting a bomb on a bombsite.
                            Each map contains two bombsites, usually opposite to one another, and the counter-terrorists must split up to defend them both.
                            On the other hand, the terrorists try to plant a bomb on one of the bombsites.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the bomb is planted, the terrorists defend the bomb while the counter-terrorists attempt to defuse it.
                            The bomb ticks for 45 seconds, and if the counter-terrorists haven't defused the bomb, it explodes and the terrorists win the round.
                            Either team can win the round by killing all the enemy players, assuming the bomb is not planted.
                            After 15 rounds, the teams swap sides; the first team to 16 wins the game.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now that you have an understanding of game's mechanics, it's time to learn how to actually move and shoot!
                            For an extensive list of all the controls in CSGO, make sure to check out the settings;
                            you can navigate to the settings by clicking the cog <a href="#home-page">from the image above.</a>
                            I recommend that you join a private lobby in order to learn and practice the controls discussed here.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="subheading">Movement</h3>
                        <p>
                            Movement in CSGO is very similar to other computer games. The "W" key causes you to move foward, "A" causes you to move foward, "D" causes you to move left, and "S" causes you to move backwards.
                            Automatically, your character is always running; running causes your footsteps to be much louder to enemies, which can give away your position.
                            Holding the "Shift" key causes your character to walk instead of run, and walking makes your footsteps inaudible.
                            Holding "Ctrl" has the same effect as walking, but it also causes your character to crouch.
                            You can also jump over obstacles and terrain by pressing the space bar.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="subheading">Weapons</h3>
                        <p>
                            Movement is great and all, but movement alone does not kill enemies, weapons do.
                            In CSGO, you have slots for a primary weapon, secondary weapon, knife, and grenade(s);
                            these slots map to the keys "1", "2", "3", and "4" respectively.
                            All characters spawn with a secondary weapon and knife, but primary weapons and grenades must be bought or picked up from dead characters.
                            Weapons can be bought by pressing "B" at the beginning of each round and clicking the desired weapon from the buy menu.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="subheading">Aiming</h3>
                        <p>
                            Arguably the most important asepct of any competetive shooter game is aiming.
                            Good aim is required in order to kill enemies before they kill you, so you can remain alive for your team.
                            The controls for aiming are simple: moving your mouse in a certain direction causes your character to look towards that direction.
                            If your mouse moves up, your character looks up, if your mouse moves to the left, your character looks to the left.
                            This mouse movement will likely feel unfamiliar, so I recommend that you practice this in a private game.
                            You can then shoot your weapon by left-clicking, and your first shots will go where your character is looking.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Movement and Aiming</h2>
                        <p>
                            Movement and aiming are closely tied to one another, especially in a game like CSGO.
                            CSGO has a somewhat unique mechanic where moving players do not shoot where their character is looking.
                            For example, if I am standing still, my bullet will hit almost exactly where my crosshair is, but if I am running,
                            my bullet has very little chance of hitting where my crosshair was.
                            The bullet will travel in a seemingly random direction.
                            There are a lot of nuances to moving, so I recommend <a href="#war_owl_movement">the video below for an in depth explanation.</a>
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Importance Mouse Sensitivity</h2>
                        <p>
                            Mouse sensitivity is the rate at which the movement of your mouse corresponds to the movement of your pointer on the display,
                            or, in our case, the movement of your crosshair.
                            A higher mouse sensitivity causes your character to move their crosshair very fast, while low mouse sensitivity is the reverse.
                            Choosing between a high and low mouse sensitivity is purely based on the player's preference, and
                            the only way to find the sensitivity for you is to try different sensitivity settings.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How to Effectively Place your Crosshair</h2>
                        <p>
                            In CSGO, the winner of a duel could come down to someone reacting milliseconds faster than their opponent.
                            For this reason, placing your crosshair in an effective spot is very important.
                            The closer your crosshair is to the enemy at the start of the engagement, the less time it takes to kill them.
                            The idea of placing your crosshair where enemies are likely to be is called crosshair placement, and the concept boils down to three general rules:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Aim your crosshair at head level.</li>
                                <li>Place your crosshair on corners where enemies may come from.</li>
                                <li>Place your crosshair in positions where the enemy is likely to be.</li>
                            </ol>
                            Rule 3 is very tricky to learn; learning where enemies are likely to be required hours of gameplay.
                            There is no shortcut to learning common enemy positions, so you must learn them as you play.
                        </p>
